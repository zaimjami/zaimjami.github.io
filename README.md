I built this repo in hopes that I could be seen more by recruiters and companies I may be interested in!

## 🚀 The Deliverable
**Live Site:** [zaimjami.github.io](https://zaimjami.github.io)

No fluff. Just the numbers.
Metric driven. Performance optimized.
It loads faster than a junior analyst grabs coffee.

## 🤖 The Arbitrage (AI Context)
Everyone applies via PDF. That's a depreciating asset.
I built an `llms.txt` file to front-run the algorithm.

- **File:** [`/llms.txt`](https://zaimjami.github.io/llms.txt)
- **Strategy:** It feeds clean data to the AI recruiters.
- **Result:** I control the narrative.

## 💼 Assets Under Management (Projects)
1. **Real Estate Sim (Rust):** Modeling cash flows. Memory safe. Zero leaks.
2. **Candy Land (C++):** Game theory. Probabilistic pathfinding.
3. **Forza Racer (Python):** Vector math. 60 FPS. High velocity.
